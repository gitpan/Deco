=head1 NAME

Deco - Module for simulating body tissue during a scuba dive

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Deco::Dive
  my $dive = Deco::Dive->new( model => 'haldane' );
  $dive->load_data_from_file( file => 'profile.txt' );
  $dive->gas( 'O2' => 40, 'N2' => 60);	
  $dive->simulate();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Deco package itself does not do anything useful, it only serves as the root of the other packages. You will want to look into the Deco::Dive module as that is the one to be using directly in your own scripts.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head1 SEE ALSO

An extensive treatment of the Haldane decompression theory is prodived in the Deco.pdf document which can be found in the docs directory.
